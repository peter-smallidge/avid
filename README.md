AVID data from the slash wall harvests and NY projects

data were collected using the AVID protocol http://avidDEER.com from
slash wall sites and from other locations in NY


data are located in the R folder "avid". The folder "AVID_katie" has her analysis for her senior honors thesis.

To read the data from the gas line and the wedge control plots use this file
avid_data_input_and_tidy_original.Rmd 

To read the data from the red pine and boot plots use this file
avid_data_boot_redpine_input_and_tidy.Rmd 

The analyses of AVID seedling height data was by linear model of estimated margin means. The file names are "avid_summary_graphs_gasline_2018-2020" and "avid_summary_graphs_boot_redpine_2018-2020." Gas line data that included fences were run separately from boot + wedge that were aggregated as 'station road'. The AVID data from the red pine stand were not used because they lacked heteroscadascity and had significant missing data that compromised data stability. The files mentioned have rudimentary graphics to assess why there was no difference in fenced versus unfenced plot outside the slash wall.
