###Visualizing the data
```{r}

  geom_point()+

#assessing if basal area associated with seedling ht unfenced

  filter(species != "bc" & harvest != "sta_rd" & inside_fence != "yes") %>% 
ggplot(aes(x=basal_area, y = ht, color=year)) +
  geom_point()+
  facet_grid(inside_slash ~ species)

#outside wall, assessing ground cover on seedling height

### coding factorials
```{r, factorial}

#the "plot" below of predict(mymod) showed that the variability
#of height was low for small seedlings and increased with large seedlings.
#This is heteroscedasticity and common in ecological data. The typical fix is
#a log transformation 
#
gasline_mod <- lm(log(ht) ~ inside_slash * inside_fence * species * year, 
            data=subset(gasline, species != "bc" & harvest != "sta_rd"))

#The original model was run without log transformation of "ht".
#The histogram of residuals was adequate, but the heteroscedasticity
#was prominently fanned. The model was thus rerun with log transformation

hist(residuals(gasline_mod)) 
#the log transformation made the distribution of residuals more normal
#note that the x-axis values are essentially -1.5 to 1.5
#
plot(predict(gasline_mod),residuals(gasline_mod)) #this tests heteroscedasticity
